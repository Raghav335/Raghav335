Purpose:

This SQL code does three main things:

1. Creates a table named EMPLOYEE.


2. Inserts some data into the table.


3. Retrieves (fetches) specific data from the table using a condition.

üß± 1. Creating the Table

CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEE (
    empId INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    dept TEXT NOT NULL
);

‚úÖ What this does:

Creates a table called EMPLOYEE.

It has three columns:

empId: An integer column that serves as the primary key (unique ID for each employee).

name: A text column for the employee's name. NOT NULL means this field must have a value.

dept: A text column for the department name. Also cannot be null.

‚úçÔ∏è 2. Inserting Data

INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE VALUES (0001, 'Clark', 'Sales');
INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE VALUES (0002, 'Dave', 'Accounting');
INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE VALUES (0003, 'Ava', 'Sales');

‚úÖ What this does:

It adds three employees to the table:

empId	name	dept

0001	Clark	Sales
0002	Dave	Accounting
0003	Ava	Sales



---

üîç 3. Fetching Data

SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE dept = 'Sales';

‚úÖ What this does:

This is a SELECT query.

It retrieves all (*) columns from the EMPLOYEE table where the department is 'Sales'.


üì§ Output:

The query returns:

empId	name	dept

1	Clark	Sales
3	Ava	Sales


Dave is not included because his department is "Accounting", not "Sales".
